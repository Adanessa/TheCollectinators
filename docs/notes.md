# Personal Notes

## Scraping Strategy
- Find better sites then stupid Inara.cz.
- Look for good spots to scrape data.
- Make sure to find suitable spots for all data needed to scrape.
- Cross-check biomes and resources with data from Starfield Wiki.

## Observations
- Some resources may appear in both domesticable and gatherable categories.
- Need to implement a tagging system to distinguish between them.

## To-Do
1. locate domesticable, gatherable, days
2. Develop URL constructor based on system names.
3. Scrape detailed planet data including biomes and resources.
4. Implement cross-checking mechanism with Starfield Wiki data.
